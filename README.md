# Health Insurance Charges Analysis Report
1) Analyzed 130,000+ health insurance records to identify factors affecting insurance costs, using Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning, manipulation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2) Developed a linear regression model using Scikit-learn, accurately predicting charges based on age, BMI, and smoking status.
3) Created visualizations such as scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, and histograms to identify trends, including a clear correlation between smoking status and higher insurance costs.
4) Documented findings in a detailed presentation, including statistical summaries, visualizations, and actionable recommendations for optimizing premium pricing based on risk factors.
